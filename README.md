## My process

I first created the card and then I positioned it.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned
- I learned how to replicate something.
- I learned how to center something. I believe that was the hardest part.

### Useful resources

- [Ways to Center a DIV WITH CSS](https://youtube.com/shorts/njdJeu95p6s?feature=share) - This helped me for centering my final card.
